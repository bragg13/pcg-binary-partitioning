# PCG - Binary Partitioning

## Description

Basic implementation of Binary Partitioning algorithm to generate dungeons.

## Functionalities

- [x] Tree representation of the dungeon
- [x] Splitting recursively each node into two nodes
- [x] Different split size (random)
- [x] Evenly split nodes
- [ ] Room definition + random size but minimum predefined
- [ ] Some decent coloring
- [x] Some more decent UI to interact with parameters
- [x] Click on space to split there
- [ ] Connect rooms with corridors
- [ ] Define themes using the tree structure
